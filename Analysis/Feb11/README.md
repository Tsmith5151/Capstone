Goal: 

Step 1: Use simstyudy package in R to simulate 5 continuous explanatory variables and 10 noise variables with a binary response variable.  

Step 2: Perform logistic regression and random forest to identify each model's ability to identify significant variables and accurately classify

Step 3: If time, create dataset 2 of 10 explanatory, 5 noise, 1 response (binary)
